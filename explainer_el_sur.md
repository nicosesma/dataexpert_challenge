# DataExpert Hackathon - El Sur Driving School Data Exporter

Web application to view and edit records from a Google Sheet and download details as a PDF form.

### Description

I built a small web application for my dad's business that allows a user to view data from a Google Sheet. The record details can be viewed and edited in a modal form, as well as exported into a PDF form. This is a small Proof-of-Concept of the data export functionality and will be extended to be officially used by the business.
